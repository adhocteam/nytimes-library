## AdHoc Updates

### Google Cloud DataStore

The Content Library has the following entities in the Google Cloud DataStore:
- `LibraryViewDoc` - Keeps track of user accesses per document
- `express-sessions` - Used by Express 

The main Google Cloud DataStore Entity used in the Content Library is `LibraryViewDoc`. `LibraryViewDoc` keeps track of each user access to a document.  As such, the ID of a LibraryViewDoc instance is a concatenation of the following: `[Google User ID]:[Google Document Id]` (delimited with a colon)

This entity keeps track each users' current number of views per document.  It has also been updated to add `vote`, `voteDate` and `voteReason`.  

Vote values are `1` for thumbs up and a `-1` for thumbs down.  The idea for using this is if we wanted to get the overall vote score of a document, we simply sum the votes. 

[Google Cloud Datastore Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/datastore/entities;kind=LibraryViewDoc;ns=__$DEFAULT$__/query/kind?project=content-library-development&supportedpurview=project).

### Templating Engine

The Library Catalog utilizes EJS as the templating engine.  The documentation can be found [here](https://ejs.co/).

The `template()` retrieves strings from the `strings.yaml` file where template string:

`template('search.results.label.person')`

will render whats specified in the `strings.yaml` file:

```
search:
  results:
    label:
      person: ...
```

### Route Handler Hooks

Router handlers can be customized by creating custom handlers in:

```
/custom/routes/...
```

For example, to create a custom page handler:

1. Create a copy of the file `/server/routes/pages.js` and put it in `/custom/routes/pages.js`
2. Customize pages.js as needed
3. Make sure all `require()` references the files the server directory. Example: `require('../../server/list')` or `require('../../utils')` and use `requireWithFallback()`.

This would be useful in cases if you wanted to modify data without resorting to middleware.  An example would be adding a property to the response without writing middleware to parse the payload or override `response.send()`.


### TypeScript and Stimulus.js

The AdHoc Content Library is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/).  

To add a new Stimulus controller to this project, add a new controller under the `/scripts/controllers` folder.  And make sure to register the new controller in the file `/scripts/index.ts`.  For more information on how to use Stimulus, please refer to the [Stimulus.js Handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction).

For example Stimulus code, refer to the `stimulus-examples` branch. [Link here](https://github.com/adhocteam/nytimes-library/tree/stimulus-examples/scripts)

The webpack compiled output will located at: `/public/bundle/bundle.js` along with the source map: `/public/bundle/bundle.js.map`.

### SASS Import and Webpack

The original NYTimes Library was built with [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).  When Webpack was added, the updated ['dart-sass'](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) is used by `sass-loader` and `node-sass` removed.

Previously, the npm build scripts used `node-sass` and `--include-paths` command line parameters where the earlier paths took precedence over later paths in the command.  This is different from the Webpack `sass-loader` which uses the concept of entry points and imports the SASS references as indicated in the entry point files.  Due to this difference, new custom `errors.scss` and `style.scss` were created to correctly import the files in correct order.

### Environment Variables Listing

The following are the available environment variables and its intended purpose:

- `ALLOW_INLINE_CODE` - Set to `true` for inline code formatter option.
- `APPROVED_DOMAINS` - Comma-delimited list of approved email domains for login.
- `DRIVE_ID` - The Google Drive ID to be used as the basis of Content Library
- `DRIVE_TIMEOUT` - Time out value for accessing Google Drive.  The default value is 10 seconds if not set.
- `DRIVE_TYPE` - The type of shared drive. If it is a shared folder, set to `folder`.  Otherwise, set to `team`.
- `EDIT_CACHE_DELAY` - Set the cache duration.  The default value is 3600.
- `GA_TRACKING_ID` - Google Analytics Tracking ID
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - Google Cloud Project ID used to connect to Google Cloud DataStore
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - Path to the credential `.json` file or `parse_json` to parse the JSON value in `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_JSON`.
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_JSON` - Service Account JSON credential.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth Client ID if `google` OAuth strategy is set.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth Client SEcret if `google` OAuth strategy is set.
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Sets the application log level.  Defaults to `debug` in development and `info` in non-development environments.  See [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging) for the log level settings.
- `LIST_UPDATE_DELAY` - Set the frequency of the file tree update.  The default value is 15 if not set.
- `NODE_ENV` - Currently running node environment.  This can be `development`, `test` or `production`.
  - `development` - Does not use Google to authenticate user, instead it uses the email specified in the `TEST_EMAIL` environment variable or `test@example.com`.  It will look for the `./auth.json` file if the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not set.  It sets the log level to `DEBUG`.  This setting is intended for local development.
  - `test` - It sets the log level to `INFO`. Sets [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) as the logger. This setting is intended for unit tests.
  - `production` - It sets the log level to `INFO`.
- `OAUTH_STRATEGY` - Sets OAuth strategy and can be either `Slack` or `google`.  The default value is `google` if not set.
- `PORT` - Port Express.js is listening on.  The default value is 3000 if not set.
- `REDIRECT_URL` - OAuth callback URL
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Key used to encrypt session data.
- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` - Slack OAuth Client ID if `Slack` OAuth strategy is set.
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` - Slack OAuth Client Secret if `Slack` OAuth strategy is set.
- `TEST_EMAIL` - Sets the email address of the logged in user when `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`. 
- `TRUST_PROXY` - The trust proxy flag tells the app to use https for links and redirect urls if it sees indications that the request passed through a proxy and was originally sent using https.

AdHoc Custom Environment Variables
- `EXCLUDE_FOLDERS` - Comma-delimiated folder IDs to be excluded from search.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nytimes/library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute code and/or documentation on GitHub or on the [demo site](https://nyt-library-demo.herokuapp.com).

## Questions

If you have questions about how to get your copy of Library up and running, [join our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyt-library-community), and let us know what you're running into. We also keep an eye on the #proj-library channel in the News Nerdery Slack. We'll do our best to answer your questions.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone and `cd` into the repo:

   `git clone git@github.com:nytimes/library.git && cd library`


2. From the Google API console, create or select a project, then create a service account with the Cloud Datastore User role. It should have API access to Drive and Cloud Datastore. Store these credentials in `server/.auth.json`.

   - To use oAuth, you will also need to create oAuth credentials.
   - To use the Cloud Datastore API for reading history, you will need to add in your `GCP_PROJECT_ID`.

3. Install dependencies:

   `npm install --no-optional`

4. Create a `.env` file at the project root. An example `.env` might look like

```bash
# node environment (development or production)
NODE_ENV=development
# Google oAuth credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=abcxyz12345
GCP_PROJECT_ID=library-demo-1234
# comma separated list of approved access domains or email addresses (regex is supported).
APPROVED_DOMAINS="nytimes.com,dailypennsylvanian.com,(.*)?ar.org,demo.user@demo.site.edu"
SESSION_SECRET=supersecretvalue

# Google drive Configuration
# team or folder ("folder" if using a folder instead of a team drive)
DRIVE_TYPE=team
# the ID of your team's drive or shared folder. The string of random numbers and letters at the end of your team drive or folder url.
DRIVE_ID=0123456ABCDEF
```
Make sure to not put any comments in the same line as `DRIVE_TYPE` and `DRIVE_ID` vars.

Ensure you share your base drive or folder with the email address associated with the service account created in step 2.

**Be careful!** Setting NODE_ENV to `development` changes the built in behaviors for site authentication to allow accounts other than those in the APPROVED_DOMAINS list. **Never use NODE_ENV=development for your deployed site, only locally.**

5. Start the app:

   `npm run watch`

The app should now be running at `localhost:3000`. Note that Library requires Node v8 or higher.

### Tests
You can run functional and unit tests, which test HTML parsing and routing logic, with `npm test`. A coverage report can be generated by running `npm run test:cover`.

The HTML parsing tests are based on the [Supported Formats doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bUE9b4_aF_IfhxCLdHApN8KKXwa4gQUCGkHzt1FyRI/edit).  To download a fresh copy of the HTML after making edits, run `node test/utils/updateSupportedFormats.js`.

## Customization
Styles, text, caching logic, and middleware can be customized to
match the branding of your organization. This is covered in the [customization readme](https://github.com/nytimes/library/blob/master/custom/README.md).

A sample customization repo is provided at [nytimes/library-customization-example](https://github.com/nytimes/library-customization-example).


## Deploying the app
Wherever you deploy Library, you'll likely want to [set up a Google service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and [OAuth 2.0 client](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) Set up your service account with API access to Drive and Cloud Datastore.

If you wish to deploy Library with customizations, create a git repo with the files you would like to include. Set the `CUSTOMIZATION_GIT_REPO` environment variable to the cloning URL. Files in the repo and packages specified in the `package.json` will be included in your library installation.

For more detailed instructions, consult the Getting Started section of the demo site: https://nyt-library-demo.herokuapp.com/get-started

### Using Heroku

This button can quickly deploy to Heroku:
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://nyti.ms/2CrT2y2)

Set your app's `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_JSON`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` with values from the service account and Oauth client. Add *<your-heroku-app-url\>.com* as an authorized domain in the general OAuth consent screen setup and then add *http://<your-heroku-app-url\>.com/auth/redirect* as the callback url in the OAuth credential setup itself.

### Using Google App Engine
You can also deploy Library to GAE, using the included `app.yaml`. Note that you will need to enable billing on your GCP project in order to use Google App Engine. More detailed instructions are provided on the [demo site](https://nyt-library-demo.herokuapp.com/get-started/deploying-library-google-app-engine).

### Using Docker [![Dockerhub](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/nytimes/library?logo=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/nytimes/library/tags)
Library can be used as a base image for deployment using Docker. This allows you
to automate building and deploying a custom version of Library during Docker's
build phase. If you create a repo with the contents of your `custom` folder, you
could deploy library from that repo with a Dockerfile like the following:

```Dockerfile
FROM nytimes/library

# copy custom files to library's custom repo
COPY . ./custom/

# move to a temporary folder install custom npm packages
WORKDIR /usr/src/tmp
COPY package*.json .npmrc ./
RUN npm i
# copy node modules required by custom node modules
RUN yes | cp -rf ./node_modules/* /usr/src/app/node_modules

# return to app directory and build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN npm run build

# start app
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

### Standard Deployment
Library is a standard node app, so it can be deployed just about anywhere. If you are looking to deploy to a standard VPS, [Digital Ocean's tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04) are a great resource.

## App structure

### Server
The main entry point to the app is `index.js`.

This file contains the express server which will respond to requests for docs
in the configured team drive or shared folder. Additionally, it contains logic
about issuing 404s and selecting the template to use based on the path.

### Views
Views (layouts) are located in the `layouts` folder. They use the `.ejs`
extension, which uses a syntax similar to underscore templates.

Base styles for the views are in the `styles` directory containing Sass files.
These files are compiled to CSS and placed in `public/css`.

### Doc parsing
Doc HTML fetch and parsing is handled by `docs.js`. `fetchDoc` takes the ID of a
Google doc and a callback, then passes the HTML of the document into the
callback once it has been downloaded and processed.

### Listing the drive
Traversing the contents of the NYT Docs folder is handled by `list.js`. There
are two exported functions:

* `getTree` is an async call that returns a nested hash (tree) of Google Drive
  Folder IDs mapped to their children. It is used by the server to determine
  whether a route is valid or not.

* `getMeta` synchronously returns a hash of Google Doc IDs to metadata objects
  that were saved in the course of populating the tree. This metadata includes
  edit history, document authors, and parent folders.

The tree and file metadata are repopulated into memory on an interval (currently 60s). Calling getTree multiple times will not return fresher data.

### Auth

Authentication with the Google Drive v3 api is handled by the auth.js file, which exposes a single method `getAuth`. `getAuth` will either return an already instantiated authentication client or produce a fresh one. Calling `getAuth` multiple times will not produce a new authentication client if the credentials have expired; we should build this into the auth.js file later to automatically refresh the credentials on some sort of interval to prevent them from expiring.

### User Authentication

Library currently supports both Slack and Google Oauth methods. As Library sites are usually intended to be internal to a set of limited users, Oauth with your organization is strongly encouraged. To use Slack Oauth, specify your Oauth strategy in your `.env` file, like so:
```
# Slack needs to be capitalized as per the Passport.js slack oauth docs http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-slack-oauth2/
OAUTH_STRATEGY=Slack
```
You will need to provide Slack credentials, which you can do by creating a Library Oauth app in your Slack workspace. After creating the app, save the app's `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` file:
```
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890abcdefg
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=09876544321qwerty
```
You will need to add a callback URL to your Slack app to allow Slack to redirect back to your Library instance after the user is authenticated.
